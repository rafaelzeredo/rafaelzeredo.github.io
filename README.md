About Me

I’m Rafael Martins Zeredo, a passionate programmer, musician, and nutrition enthusiast. With a diverse set of interests and skills, I bring a unique perspective to every project I undertake. This website is a reflection of my journey and achievements across various domains.

Projects

Here are some highlights of my programming projects:

Project Volume: Volume is a project developed in C to read the bytes from a file and work with them to increase the volume of wav files, finding the headers of deleated jpeg files and restoring them.
Project DNA: A python app built to compare sequencences of DNA to two different databases, the app works using principles and DNA sequences used by the FBI.
Filter: An app that takes a photo and works with the photo pixel by pixel rearranging the red, green and blue of each pixel using algorithms specific to each effect the filter can apply.
Feel free to explore the Projects section of this site for more detailed information and links to each project.

Music

In addition to programming, I am an avid musician, producer, singer and songwriter. Here are some of my musical endeavors:

Dream: Dream is a song written at the beggining of 2023, and it brings a magical world to life, where a romantic dream featuring beautiful landscapes and artistic vibes from start to finish.
Perto de Você: This is a song I wrote in portuguese and was the first one I released. It is special to me because it got me to record more of my own songs at a famous bans's studio in BH called Skank. The band's bass player, Marcos Zanetti, aka Lelo, invited me to a recording session in the studio after he heard the song. "This song would play non stop at Jovem Pan if given the chance" (Marcos Zanetti).
